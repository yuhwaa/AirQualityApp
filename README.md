## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap

I developed this app out of a personal curiosity to gain deeper insights into air quality index details, especially during a severe wildfire in Canada.

## Optimizations
I incorporated an intuitive color coding system into the app's user interface, effectively utilizing various colors to visually represent distinct air quality levels, thus enhancing user experience by providing quick and easily interpretable information on air quality conditions.
